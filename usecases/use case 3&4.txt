Use Case 3: Heart Rhythm Analysis
Primary Actor: User
Scope: AED device
Level: user level
Precondition: The AED device is powered on and operational and the AED has undergone a self-test to ensure proper functionality. The electrode pads placed in the correct place.
Flow:
1.Triggering Heart Rhythm Analysis:
The AED is activated, either manually by a user or automatically when turned on. Upon activation, the device starts analyzing the patient's heart rhythm.
2.Electrode Placement:
The user follows visual prompts or instructions on the AED to correctly attach the electrodes to specific locations on the patient's chest for analysis.
3.Continuous Monitoring:
As the electrodes are connected, the AED monitors the electrical activity of the heart in real-time, assessing for ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
4.Analysis Result:
Based on the analysis, the AED determines whether the patient's heart rhythm is shockable or not. It then prompts the user with the result, indicating the appropriate course of action.
5.Integration with Display:
The AED visually displays the analysis result on its screen, making it easy for the user to interpret the information.
Postconditions:
AED provides a clear analysis result for further action.
Exceptions:
Inaccurate Electrode Placement: If the electrodes are not placed correctly, the AED informs the user and prompts reattachment.




Use Case 4: Voice and Visual Prompts
Primary Actor: User
Scope: AED device
Level: User level
Precondition: The AED device is powered on and operational and the AED has undergone a self-test to ensure proper functionality. The electrode pads placed in the correct place.
Flow:
1.Activation Prompt:
The AED should provide a clear activation prompt upon initiation. When activated, the AED emits a voice prompt and displays on-screen instructions, guiding the user through the initial steps.
2.Analyzing Announcement:
As the AED analyzes the heart rhythm, it should audibly announce the ongoing analysis process. Simultaneously, a visual prompt may indicate the analysis phase on the display.
3.Shock Advisory Prompt:
If the analysis determines a shockable rhythm, the AED issues a prompt, both verbally and visually, stating "Shock advised" to instruct the user to prepare for a shock.
4.User Confirmation Prompt:
Users must confirm understanding before the AED delivers a shock.
5.Post-Shock Instruction:
 After a shock is delivered or if no shock is advised, the AED issues further prompts, guiding the user on the next steps.
Postconditions:
 AED provides clear voice and visual prompts, guiding the user through each stage of the emergency response.
Exceptions:
User Misunderstanding: If the user does not confirm understanding, the AED repeats the prompt until confirmation is received.
